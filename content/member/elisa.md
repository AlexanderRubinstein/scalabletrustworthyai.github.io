My personal page is at [elisanguyen.github.io](https://elisanguyen.github.io). 

I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)). 

Before, I absolved my Master’s in [Interaction Technology at the University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/interaction-technology/) and my Bachelor’s in [Computer Science and Management at the Nordakademie](https://www.nordakademie.de/duales-studium/wirtschaftsinformatik). I did my Bachelor studies in a [dual study format](https://www.daad.de/en/study-and-research-in-germany/plan-your-studies/dual-study-programmes/) in cooperation with Airbus, where I also worked for about 2.5 years as an IT project manager for CAD software projects in waterfall and agile projects.
